I made this a few years ago (2018?) while following a tutorial at Udemy.com. I tried to make it my own tho. I was not new to Python but needed a good example of a more substantial program and this was a good one. I followed the class setups but after that I completed the program myself. I don't take credit for this - Thanks Udemy!

It is still fun to play...I want to improve it to give the option to continue playing rounds, and add currency to the mix so it tells you how much money you made (or lost) as the games progress.
